Java 24 will be released in March of 2025, but we already know some of the features that will make it in.
So let us take a closer look at what's awaiting us!

== Final

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/472[JEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI] - This JEP is geared towards issue warnings in a consistent manner in case of JNI or FFM usage that goes against https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968[integrity by default]. These warnings and future restrictions can be selectively disabled by enabling those specific interfaces when needed.

== Candidate
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/404[JEP 404: Generational Shenandoah (Experimental)] - This aims to enhance the Shenandoah GC with an experimental generational mode, without impacting non-generational. It aims to reduce the sustained memory footprint, and reduce resource consumption. Initially it'll only support X64 and AArch64, with more instruction sets being supported later.

== Preview

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/401[Value Classes and Objects] - Enhances the java platform with value objects, which are class instances that lack an object identity, and only have final fields. Popular classes that represent simple values in the JDK such as Integer will be migrated, and there'll be support for compatible migration of user-defined classes. This will help to improve the memory footprint, locality and GC efficiency.

== Incubation
