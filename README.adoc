Java 24 will be released in March of 2025, but we already know some of the features that will make it in.
So let us take a closer look at what's awaiting us!

== Proposed to target

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/498[JEP 498: Warn upon Use of Memory-Access Methods in sun.misc.Unsafe] - Starting in JDK 24, a runtime warning will be issued upon the first invocation of any method in sun.misc.Unsafe, which has been fully deprecated, with the recommendation that developers migrate to the standard VarHandle API (JEP 193) and Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 454) to ensure smooth transitions in future JDK releases.

== Targeted
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/404[JEP 404: Generational Shenandoah (Experimental)] - This aims to enhance the Shenandoah GC with an experimental generational mode, without impacting non-generational. It aims to reduce the sustained memory footprint, and reduce resource consumption. Initially it'll only support X64 and AArch64, with more instruction sets being supported later.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/450[JEP 450: Compact Object Headers (Experimental)] - Geared towards object header sizes on 64-bit architectures (x64 and AArch64) without introducing any major throughput or latency overhead.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/472[JEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI] - This JEP is geared towards issue warnings in a consistent manner in case of JNI or FFM usage that goes against https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968[integrity by default]. These warnings and future restrictions can be selectively disabled by enabling those specific interfaces when needed.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/475[JEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1]  - Simplifies the G1 GC barrier implementation, which stores information about the application memory access by moving the expansion of the expansion thereof to later in the C2 JIT's compilation pipeline. This makes the G1 barriers more comprehensible, reduced the C2 execution time when using the G1 collector and guarantees the preservation of the C2 invariants while preserving the quality of C2 generated code.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/479[JEP 479: Remove the Windows 32-bit x86 Port]  - As planned after the deprecation for removal in JDK 21 (JEP 449) the Windows 32 bit X86 bit source code and build support has been removed.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/484[JEP 484: Class-File API] - This JEP which was initially a preview in 22 and 23 aims to provide a standard API for parsing, generating and transforming Java class files. It aims to help developers handle the swifter release cadence, and thus class-file format changes. This class-file API would evolve alongside the class file format, which would reduce the reliance of library and framework developers on third-party developers to update and test their class-file libraries. Frameworks and libraries making use the standard API will support class files from the latest JDK automatically.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/491[JEP 491: Synchronize Virtual Threads without Pinning] - which aims to improve scalability of synchronized methods & statements by making it possible for Virtual Threads that block in such cases to release their underlying platform threads. This will almost fully eliminate cases of VT being pinned to platform threads.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/493[JEP 493: Linking Run-Time Images without JMODs] - This aims to facilitate run-time image generate from modules regardless of what those modules were (JMOD, modular JAR, part of a previously linked run-time, etc.). This will also reduce the JDK size by enabling the jlink tool to create custom images without using the JDK's JMOD files. NOTE: this feature might not be enabled by all vendors.

== Integrated

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[JEP 483: Ahead-of-Time Class Loading & Linking] - This feature aims to enhance Java application startup performance by monitoring an application during one run and creating a cache of pre-loaded and pre-linked classes for subsequent runs. It seeks to improve startup time by leveraging the typically consistent startup process of applications, without requiring changes to application code, command-line usage, or build tools. The approach provides a foundation for future improvements in startup and warmup time, with the current implementation focusing on caching classes loaded by built-in class loaders from the class path, module path, and JDK itself.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/485[JEP 485: Stream Gatherers] - This JEP enhances the Stream API with new intermediate operations to facilitate new data operations that previously weren't easily achievable. This will be handled by facilitating the creation of custom intermediate operations to to manipulate the streams, rather than a lot of new methods of the specifically requested functions.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/486[JEP 486: Permanently Disable the Security Manager] - This proposal aims to phase out the Security Manager, which has been largely unused for securing client and server-side Java code, by removing the ability to enable it during runtime and revising the Java Platform specification to minimize its references. The changes will have minimal impact on most applications and tools, with the goal of improving JDK maintainability by reducing the complexity of resource-access decision delegation. The Security Manager API will be retained in this release to provide existing code maintainers time to migrate, with no intention of providing a replacement for its previous sandboxing or API interception functionalities.
== Candidate

== Preview

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/401[JEP 401: Value Classes and Objects] - Enhances the java platform with value objects, which are class instances that lack an object identity, and only have final fields. Popular classes that represent simple values in the JDK such as Integer will be migrated, and there'll be support for compatible migration of user-defined classes. This will help to improve the memory footprint, locality and GC efficiency.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/478[JEP 478: Key Derivation Function API (Preview)
] - This proposal aims to introduce an API to derive additional keys from a secret key and other data through cryptographic algorithms as Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/487[JEP 487: Scoped values (Fourth Preview)
] - Scoped values are being introduced as a preview API (fourth iteration) to enable methods to share immutable data both within threads and with child threads, offering better efficiency and clarity than thread-local variables, especially when used with virtual threads and structured concurrency.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/488[JEP 488: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Second Preview)
] - This JEP first introduced as 455 returns without any changes. It aims to enhance pattern matching by allowing primitives in all pattern contexts, and allowing one to use them with instanceof and switch as well.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/499[JEP 499: Structured Concurrency (Fourth Preview)
] - This is the fourth iteration of the JEP geared towards making concurrent programming easier to develop.


== Incubation

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/489[JEP 489 Vector API (Ninth Incubator)] - This JEP geared towards introducing an API for vector computations return for its ninth iteration. It aims to provide a way to express these in a manner that compiles reliably to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU architectures to achieve better performance than equivalent scalar computations.

== Removed
