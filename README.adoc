Java 24 will be released in March of 2025, but we already know some of the features that will make it in.
So let us take a closer look at what's awaiting us!

== Targeted

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/472[JEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI] - This JEP is geared towards issue warnings in a consistent manner in case of JNI or FFM usage that goes against https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968[integrity by default]. These warnings and future restrictions can be selectively disabled by enabling those specific interfaces when needed.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/475[JEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1]  - Simplifies the G1 GC barrier implementation, which stores information about the application memory access by moving the expansion of the expansion thereof to later in the C2 JIT's compilation pipeline. This makes the G1 barriers more comprehensible, reduced the C2 execution time when using the G1 collector and guarantees the preservation of the C2 invariants while preserving the quality of C2 generated code.
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/484[JEP 484: Class-File API] - This JEP which was initially a preview in 22 and 23 aims to provide a standard API for parsing, generating and transforming Java class files. It aims to help developers handle the swifter release cadence, and thus class-file format changes. This class-file API would evolve alongside the class file format, which would reduce the reliance of library and framework developers on third-party developers to update and test their class-file libraries. Frameworks and libraries making use the standard API will support class files from the latest JDK automatically.


== Candidate
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/404[JEP 404: Generational Shenandoah (Experimental)] - This aims to enhance the Shenandoah GC with an experimental generational mode, without impacting non-generational. It aims to reduce the sustained memory footprint, and reduce resource consumption. Initially it'll only support X64 and AArch64, with more instruction sets being supported later.

== Preview

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/401[Value Classes and Objects] - Enhances the java platform with value objects, which are class instances that lack an object identity, and only have final fields. Popular classes that represent simple values in the JDK such as Integer will be migrated, and there'll be support for compatible migration of user-defined classes. This will help to improve the memory footprint, locality and GC efficiency.

== Incubation

== Removed
